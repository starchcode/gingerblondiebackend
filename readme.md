## General info

I created this Back-End app using ExperssJS. App is responsible for automated tasks as well as handling API calls. It automatically renews the Instagram Token which can expire in 60 days!

## Features

* __Fetch data from client's Instagram__ to be delivered to front-end.
* __Handling contact form__ with use of [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer). _messages will be delivered to client's gmail_.
* __API calls to Mailchimp newsletter__. App will check wheather users are subscribed or not then shows the appropriate message!
* __Fetch all the data from Wordpress API__ that need to be loaded on the website _(blog, recipes & food)_.
* __Automation tasks__ such as renewing Instagram Token which can expire within 60 days if not renewed. A copy of the token will be sent to Admin's email!
